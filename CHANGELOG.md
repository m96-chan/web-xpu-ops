## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `npm test` runs one test file per vitest process. A single process cannot cross
  a test-file boundary with a GPU device in play — it aborts inside Dawn's thread
  pool or hangs, with no kernel of its own required to trigger it. The runner also
  refuses to report a false pass: a crashed vitest worker can exit 0 having
  skipped most of the suite, so every file is now accounted for individually.

### Added

- `harness` — a WGSL runner over Dawn in Node, an `agree` comparator that passes
  an element on either relative or absolute difference, and a suite helper that
  creates exactly one GPU device per run. The comparator is not equality because
  the references run in f64 and the kernels in f32; the single device is because
  the GPU binding is a native module that does not survive vitest recycling its
  workers.
- `rmsnorm` — workgroup tree reduction, with `eps` guarding an all-zero row.
- `softmax` — max-subtracted, so real logits do not overflow `exp`.
- `activation` — `relu2` and `silu`.
- `elementwise` — `add` and `multiply`.
- `rope` — rotary position embedding, with a KV-cache offset.
- `quantize` — per-row absmax to int8, symmetric over `[-127, 127]`.
- `dequantize` — applies both the weight scale and the activation scale.
- `matvec` (GEMV) — one vector against a `[M, K]` row-major matrix, following
  `torch.mv` rather than BLAS `sgemv`: no `alpha`, no `beta`, no transpose flag.
  It exists as its own op rather than as a path through a future `matmul`
  because it reads every weight exactly once and reuses none of them, so the
  kernel is written to stream — lanes walk a row at the workgroup stride, which
  keeps each pass one contiguous burst — and the tiling that makes GEMM fast has
  nothing to capture here. Autoregressive decoding is this shape at every step.
  Speed is **unmeasured**: the bandwidth roofline it should be reported against
  does not exist yet.
