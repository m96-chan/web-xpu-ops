## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `npm test` runs one test file per vitest process. A single process cannot cross
  a test-file boundary with a GPU device in play — it aborts inside Dawn's thread
  pool or hangs, with no kernel of its own required to trigger it. The runner also
  refuses to report a false pass: a crashed vitest worker can exit 0 having
  skipped most of the suite, so every file is now accounted for individually.

### Added

- `harness` — a WGSL runner over Dawn in Node, an `agree` comparator that passes
  an element on either relative or absolute difference, and a suite helper that
  creates exactly one GPU device per run. The comparator is not equality because
  the references run in f64 and the kernels in f32; the single device is because
  the GPU binding is a native module that does not survive vitest recycling its
  workers.
- `rmsnorm` — workgroup tree reduction, with `eps` guarding an all-zero row.
- `softmax` — max-subtracted, so real logits do not overflow `exp`.
- `activation` — `relu2` and `silu`.
- `elementwise` — `add` and `multiply`.
- `rope` — rotary position embedding, with a KV-cache offset.
- `quantize` — per-row absmax to int8, symmetric over `[-127, 127]`.
- `dequantize` — applies both the weight scale and the activation scale.
- `matvec` (GEMV) — one vector against a `[M, K]` row-major matrix, following
  `torch.mv` rather than BLAS `sgemv`: no `alpha`, no `beta`, no transpose flag.
  It exists as its own op rather than as a path through a future `matmul`
  because it reads every weight exactly once and reuses none of them, so the
  kernel is written to stream — lanes walk a row at the workgroup stride, which
  keeps each pass one contiguous burst — and the tiling that makes GEMM fast has
  nothing to capture here. Autoregressive decoding is this shape at every step.
  Speed is **unmeasured**: the bandwidth roofline it should be reported against
  does not exist yet.
- `matmul` — GEMM (`C = A @ B`) with a shared-memory tiled WGSL kernel. Separate
  from GEMV because the reuse a tile buys is the only reason this shape can be
  compute-bound, and none of it applies to a batch of one. Shapes that do not
  divide by the tile are where tiled kernels are fast and wrong, so the ragged
  tails are tested on their own and together — including against buffers longer
  than the operands, because this device reads past the end of a buffer as zero
  and would otherwise hide a missing tail guard.
- `scatter` — indexed writes where **colliding indices accumulate**, via an f32
  compare-exchange atomic. The rule had to be decided rather than discovered:
  "last write wins" is undefined behaviour on a GPU, since nothing orders the
  threads reaching a slot, and callers would have built on whichever answer
  their own device happened to give. Accumulation is the only rule that is the
  same for every ordering, and it is what gradient accumulation, MoE dispatch
  and bincount need. Matches `scatter_add_` in PyTorch, not `scatter_`.
- `transpose` — 2D, staged through a 16x16 workgroup tile. The tile is there
  because transpose computes nothing: the only thing it can get wrong is where a
  value lands, and the only thing it can be slow at is reaching memory. Turning
  the tile inside the workgroup keeps both the read and the write consecutive,
  which the obvious one-line version does for the read only. Shapes that do not
  divide by 16 are the case that matters — the leftover threads address inside
  the buffer, so an unguarded write replaces a real value instead of faulting.
- `reduce` — `sum` / `max` / `min` / `mean` along one axis, over a tensor viewed
  as `[outer, axis, inner]` so that any axis of any rank fits. rmsnorm and
  softmax each carry their own copy of the workgroup tree reduction, and a third
  copy was about to be written; this is that reduction with the combiner and the
  identity lifted out. The edges follow PyTorch and are stated rather than
  implied: an empty axis sums to `0`, means to `NaN`, and is an error for `max`
  and `min`; `mean` always divides by the axis length. Callers who get those
  wrong get them wrong quietly, which is why they are written down.
- `gather` — row selection for embedding lookup, matching
  `torch.index_select(table, 0, indices)` rather than `torch.gather`, because
  embedding lookup is why the op exists and the two names are close enough to
  pick the wrong one by accident. An index outside `[0, rows)` gathers zeros:
  PyTorch raises there and a kernel cannot, and the alternatives — clamping or
  wrapping — hand back a real embedding for a token that was never in the
  vocabulary, which looks plausible all the way downstream.
- `attention` — unfused scaled dot-product attention, in two dispatches:
  `softmax(mask(scale * Q @ K^T))` writes the attention matrix, then `@ V` reads
  it. Slower than a fused kernel by construction, and worth having anyway,
  because it is what makes the fused one verifiable — `flash_attention` has no
  other definition of correct to be measured against.
  Conventions follow `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`, checked
  against torch 2.10 rather than read off the docs, because the two that matter
  both have a plausible wrong answer: `scale` defaults to `1/sqrt(D)` from the
  **query's** head dim even when V's differs, and `causal` is **upper-left**
  aligned, so with a KV cache longer than the query it keeps keys `0..i` rather
  than the most recent `i+1`. That second one is a trap for the case the op
  exists to serve, so masking is parameterised by `queryOffset` — the absolute
  position of query row 0 in the key sequence — which reaches `is_causal=True`
  at `0` and `causal_lower_right` at `S - L` without a second flag.
  Speed is **unmeasured**: the roofline harness it should be reported against
  does not exist yet.
