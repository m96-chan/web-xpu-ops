## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `harness` — a WGSL runner over Dawn in Node, an `agree` comparator that passes
  an element on either relative or absolute difference, and a suite helper that
  creates exactly one GPU device per run. The comparator is not equality because
  the references run in f64 and the kernels in f32; the single device is because
  the GPU binding is a native module that does not survive vitest recycling its
  workers.
- `rmsnorm` — workgroup tree reduction, with `eps` guarding an all-zero row.
- `softmax` — max-subtracted, so real logits do not overflow `exp`.
- `activation` — `relu2` and `silu`.
- `elementwise` — `add` and `multiply`.
- `rope` — rotary position embedding, with a KV-cache offset.
- `quantize` — per-row absmax to int8, symmetric over `[-127, 127]`.
- `dequantize` — applies both the weight scale and the activation scale.
- `transpose` — 2D, staged through a 16x16 workgroup tile. The tile is there
  because transpose computes nothing: the only thing it can get wrong is where a
  value lands, and the only thing it can be slow at is reaching memory. Turning
  the tile inside the workgroup keeps both the read and the write consecutive,
  which the obvious one-line version does for the read only. Shapes that do not
  divide by 16 are the case that matters — the leftover threads address inside
  the buffer, so an unguarded write replaces a real value instead of faulting.
