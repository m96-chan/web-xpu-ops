## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `harness` — a WGSL runner over Dawn in Node, an `agree` comparator that passes
  an element on either relative or absolute difference, and a suite helper that
  creates exactly one GPU device per run. The comparator is not equality because
  the references run in f64 and the kernels in f32; the single device is because
  the GPU binding is a native module that does not survive vitest recycling its
  workers.
- `rmsnorm` — workgroup tree reduction, with `eps` guarding an all-zero row.
- `softmax` — max-subtracted, so real logits do not overflow `exp`.
- `activation` — `relu2` and `silu`.
- `elementwise` — `add` and `multiply`.
- `rope` — rotary position embedding, with a KV-cache offset.
- `quantize` — per-row absmax to int8, symmetric over `[-127, 127]`.
- `dequantize` — applies both the weight scale and the activation scale.
- `matmul` — GEMM (`C = A @ B`) with a shared-memory tiled WGSL kernel. Separate
  from GEMV because the reuse a tile buys is the only reason this shape can be
  compute-bound, and none of it applies to a batch of one. Shapes that do not
  divide by the tile are where tiled kernels are fast and wrong, so the ragged
  tails are tested on their own and together — including against buffers longer
  than the operands, because this device reads past the end of a buffer as zero
  and would otherwise hide a missing tail guard.
